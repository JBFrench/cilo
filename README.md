# Cilo
__Cilo__ stands for Continuous Integration Locally and is a decentralized continuous delivery build platform with a focus on fast feedback, minimal setup, and secure credentials management. 

## Goals
The goal of __Cilo__ is to give developers the ability to build and deploy applications from their own machines while still allowing organizations to enforce quality gates and restrict direct access to secure information like passwords and other credentials.

  git clone git@github.com:cirrosoft/cilo.git
